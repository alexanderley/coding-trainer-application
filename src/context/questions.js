    question: "What is the difference between == and === in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "The double equals (==) performs type coercion, which means it converts the operands to the same type before making the comparison. The triple equals (===) does not perform type coercion and only returns true if the operands have the same type and value.\nThis means that if we would compare a 0 with the string '0' we would get true returned, when compared with (==) because it will convert both to a string before comparing them to each other, this would not be the case if done with (===).",

    question: "What is closure in JavaScript and give an example?",
    answer:
      "In JavaScript, closure refers to the combination of a function and the lexical environment in which it was declared. A lexical environment consists of any variables or functions that were declared in the same scope as the function, as well as any variables or functions declared in any outer scopes. When a function is defined inside another function, the inner function has access to the variables and functions in the outer function's lexical environment, even after the outer function has returned. This is because the inner function forms a closure over the variables and functions in the outer function's lexical environment.",

    question: "What is event bubbling in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "Event bubbling is a mechanism in JavaScript where an event is propagated from the innermost element to the outermost element. When you click on an element, the event starts at the target element and then propagates to the parent elements until it reaches the document object.",
  },

    id: 29,
    question: "What is event delegation in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where you attach an event handler to a parent element instead of individual elements. The event is then propagated from the target element to the parent element, where it can be handled in a centralized manner. This technique is useful for improving performance when you have many elements that need to handle the same event.",

This method is executed only once in the lifecycle of a component and is a good place to set the initial state of the component and make ajax calls to get data to render the component. componentDidMount is called after a component has been successfully mounted on the DOM and rendered for the first time. This method is also executed only once in the lifecycle of a component and is a good place to interact with the DOM and other APIs as the component is already available in the DOM at this stage. In summary, componentWillMount is called before the first render, and componentDidMount is called after the first render.",
